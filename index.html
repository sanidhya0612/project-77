            <br>
            Write about console screen and why it is used and how to open console screen and print 
            anything on it.

            If you want to use the inspect element then right click on the mouse or the trackpad and 
            you will find the option of inspect at the bottom.
            <br>
            Now click on the console and you can view console but if you also want to use the console element 
            then you have to code on it using the 'console.log()' code element and that's it.
